By making use of OpenCV, the machine learning and computuer vision library of Python, I have developed a design in which the volume and brightness levels of a device can be controlled by using hand gestures. I have made use of the following libraries to do the same.
cv2 (OpenCV): For video capture and image processing.
mediapipe: For hand gesture recognition.
screen_brightness_control: For controlling screen brightness.
pycaw: For controlling system volume.
